    <p><h1>Hank Hayes</h1></p>
    <!-- <p class="lead mb-3">My name is Hank and I'm a junior MIS major at UT Austin's McCombs School of Business. Explore the website and get to know me better!</p> -->
    <!-- <p>As a third-year MIS major at UT Austin, I'm exploring what I want to do post-grad. I'm currently pursuing an internship in either project management, software engineering, or consulting because I believe they align well with my interests and would foster my growth as a person. That being said, I'm incredibly open to opportunities of any kind, in any industry! My only critera is that I'm able to develop my leadership and critical thinking skills.</p> -->
    <!-- <p>I've learned that the most important thing in searching for a job is discovering what you're most passionate about. To me, that is solving problems and meeting new people. I take a very hands-on and investigative approach to solving problems. In my most recent internship at Dell, this meant interviewing 50+ people over the course of 10 weeks to find their most common pain points surrounding the idea management process.</p> -->

    <h4>The person</h4>
    <p>Originally from El Paso, TX I moved to Austin, TX in 2020 to attend UT Austin. I've played basketball, video games , and the piano nearly my whole life, all of which have guided my interests over time.</p>

    <h4>The student</h4>
    <p>I'm a senior at The University of Texas at Austin studying at the McCombs School of Business. I'm studying Management Information Systems and getting a certificate in Computer Science.</p>

    <h4>The professional</h4>
    <p>I worked for Dell in the summer of 2022 and am currently working for LPL Financial and Apple.</p>
