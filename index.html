<h1 class="text-left pd-5">Hello there!</h1>
<p class="lead mb-3">My name is Hank and I'm a junior MIS major at UT Austin's McCombs School of Business. Explore the website and get to know me better!</p>
<p>As a third-year MIS major at UT Austin, I'm exploring what I want to do post-grad. I'm currently pursuing an internship in either project management, software engineering, or consulting because I believe they align well with my interests and would foster my growth as a person. That being said, I'm incredibly open to opportunities of any kind, in any industry! My only criterion is that I'm able to develop my leadership and critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>I've learned that the most important thing in searching for a job is discovering what you're most passionate about. To me, that is solving problems and meeting new people. I take a very hands-on and investigative approach to solving problems. In my most recent internship at Dell, this meant interviewing 50+ people over the course of 10 weeks to find their most common pain points surrounding the idea management process.</p>
