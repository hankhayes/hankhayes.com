        <p>I've always wanted to have a personal website that I could use as a portfolio/resume, but I never wanted to pay Squarespace or Wix for their website builders. This may not be as beautiful as a Squarespace site but it gets the job done, and I'm actually pretty proud of the landing page.</p>
        <p>Hankhayes.com is formatted with HTML, styled with CSS (Bootstrap), hosted for free on Azure, and uses Javascript for animations and to provide consistent formatting on mobile devices.</p>
        <p>I actually wrote a blog post for students (or anyone really) who want to do the same thing, <a href="https://hankhayes.substack.com/p/coming-soon">which can be found here</a>! The repository is public on <a href="https://github.com/hankhayes/hankhayes.com">my GitHub</a> as well, so check it out if you're interested in doing the same.</p>

        <p>MIS 333K is a right of passage as an MIS major at UT Austin. This is the project that my team and I created over the course of about 2 months. Longhorn Recruiting is a job board that allows students and recruiters to interact in a variety of ways. Job recruiters can post jobs, schedule interviews, and search for talent. Students can browse companies, search for jobs, apply to those jobs, and schedule interviews.</p>
        <p>Longhorn Recruiting is built with Microsoft's ASP.NET framework and uses the MVC architecture. It was created using HTML, CSS, C#, Javascript, SQL, and Azure. My group and I nearly completed all of the project requirements (sounds funny, but is actually quite rare) and finished in 6 place out of about 30 teams.</p>

        <p>I (along with my two teammates) developed The Last Wizard during our time in CS 329E: Game Development. It's a top-down, fantasy RPG game where you get to explore and fight enemies.  </p>
        <p>The Last Wizard was built using the Godot engine and all characters were created in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
